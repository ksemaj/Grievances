## Security Features

This app implements multiple layers of security:

1. **Password Authentication**: Shared password (client-side) prevents unauthorized access
2. **Auto-Logout Timer**: 15-minute inactivity timeout with 2-minute warning
3. **Input Validation**: Title (200 chars) and description (2000 chars) limits
4. **XSS Protection**: DOMPurify sanitizes all user input before display
5. **Rate Limiting**: 30s cooldown for submissions, 60s for notifications
6. **CORS Restriction**: Discord function only accepts requests from production domain
7. **Content Security Policy**: Browser-level XSS protection via meta tag
8. **Row-Level Security**: Database-level access control (see [`docs/setup/SUPABASE_RLS_SETUP.md`](docs/setup/SUPABASE_RLS_SETUP.md))

## Deployment

1. Deploy with [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard (Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables)
3. Set up RLS policies in Supabase (see [`docs/setup/SUPABASE_RLS_SETUP.md`](docs/setup/SUPABASE_RLS_SETUP.md))
4. Ensure Discord webhook URL is set in Supabase Edge Functions
